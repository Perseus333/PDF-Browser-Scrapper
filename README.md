# pdf-browser-search-filtration
A python program that shows only the pdfs of what you have searched instead of all those scamy websites that require you to login to read/download the document.
It outputs a list of the PDFs and also gives you the oportunity to send them to yourself to save them for later, note that this will reuqire you to allow
less secure apps using this link: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

Be aware that the program only shows the PDFs of the first page of google instead of all of them, I will be working on that, and hopefully it should be fized soon
